# jtree
A javascript toolbox for running economics experiments.

#### Planned features
Same look and functionality as zTree, plus:
- option to write treatments in javascript + html.
- participants only need a browser to connect (so works on laptops, desktops, mobile phones, tablets, etc.); 
- server also runs on MacOS/Linux.

### UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Parts of the documentation are accurate, others are out of date, while still others refer to functionality that will be implemented soon (but for the moment still does not exist). Proceed with caution.
