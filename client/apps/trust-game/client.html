        <p>RESULTS</p>
        <p>Player 1 started with an endowment of E$<span jt-text='app.p1endowment'></span>.</p>
        <p>Player 1 sent E$<span jt-text='group.p1send'></span> to Player 2.</p>
        <p>This amount was multiplied by the multiplier (<span jt-text='app.multiplier'></span>), so in total Player 2 received
            E$<span jt-text='group.p2received'></span>.</p>
        <p>Player 2 chose to return E$<span jt-text='group.p2return'></span>, therefore the payoffs are E$<span jt-text='group.p1points'></span> for Player 1
            and E$<span jt-text='group.p2points'></span> for Player 2.</p>
