        <p>Your guess was <span jt-text='player.guess'></span>.</p>
        <p>The sum of guesses in your group was <span jt-text='group.totalGuesses'></span>. The multiplier was <span jt-text='app.multiplier' jt-decimals=2></span>, therefore the target was <span jt-text='group.target' jt-decimals=2></span>.</p>
        <p>There were <span jt-text='group.numWinners'></span> winning guesses.</p>
        <p jt-displayIf='player.points>0'>Your guess was one of the closest to this amount.</p>
        <p jt-displayIf='player.points===0'>Your guess was not one of the closest to this amount.</p>
        <p>Thus, in this period your payoff was <span jt-text='player.points' jt-decimals=2>Z</span> EUR.</p>
