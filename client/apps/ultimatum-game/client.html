        <p>The pie size was E$<span jt-text='app.pieSize'></span>.</p>
        <p>Player 1 proposed to take E$<span jt-text='group.proposalForP1'></span> for themselves, and let Player 2 take E$<span jt-text='group.proposalForP2'></span>.
        <p>Player 2 chose to <span jt-text='group.choice'></span> this proposal, therefore the payoffs were E$<span jt-text='group.p1points'></span> for Player 1
            and E$<span jt-text='group.p2points'></span> for Player 2.</p>
